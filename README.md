# Minesweeper-with-Tkinter
This Game is developed with tkinter and some native python modules.

Please install all the required modules with the code below.

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

To run the program, open the main.py and run the file. 

But if you want to directly open the game without using any python sctipt, go to build/exe.win-amd64-3.9 and run the main.exe file and you should see the game pop up. 

Enjoy the game.
